Pretty much everything working now. The live preview works as does the delayed publishing / draft mode.

There is a save button that you use first. Then there is the *set status* dropdown on the right with 3 options:

1. Draft
2. In review - not sure what this does.
3. Ready

 Choose ready in order to publish. Then you can press the publish dropdown and choose *publish now*.

**NB. These buttons are not visible until saved.**
