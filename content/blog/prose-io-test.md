summary: A post on Prose.io

Will frontmatter be generated? No. I had to add it myself. This is a real show stopper. If you can't create a new post without being able to add frontmatter you're not going anywhere.



**CONCLUSION** - Prose.io is not much use for static sites with the possible exception of Jekyll, for which there is a specific config file.
