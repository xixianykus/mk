summary: "Running Netlify CMS locally"

The CMS runs locally through the Hugo server. Just add */admin* to the end of the localhost port number.

However you need to enable Git summat or other to be able to login. I also think edits done this way will be to the GitHub repo NOT the local one.

Nevertheless this is a good way to look at the code and figure out any CSS changes.
