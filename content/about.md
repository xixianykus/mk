I’m a professional journalist, writer and editor with experience in diverse topics from environmentalism to adventure sports. My broad range of interests is one of the reasons I got into journalism in the first place, alongside a desire to pique people’s awareness, curiosity and knowledge about important and relevant matters. I focus on writing about topics I’m passionate about and hope to offer new perspectives and inspiration to others.

I began my journalism career in Punta Arenas, Chile, working for Patagonian Expedition Race. There I wrote articles and copy about this prestigious multi-day adventure race across Patagonia, with an emphasis on the organisation’s main corporate value—supporting eco-tourism and environmental awareness.

Enthusiastic about accelerating environmentally conscious practices and sustainable development through my writing, I’ve since worked as a journalist for the Climate Action Programme—partners of the United Nations Environment Programme. There I wrote about various topics, including clean technology, sustainability and biodiversity. With the position continuing in parallel with the UN Climate Change Conference, timely, balanced and accurate coverage of information regarding the event was central.

Since this position, I’ve continued to apply my values for environmental sustainability to my writing about business, travel and lifestyle. In my position with Travel Trade Publications, I investigated and reported on the development of a green economy in the travel industry in destinations within the Middle East and North Africa. These detailed travel trade features and interview pages also explored various other topics of broad interest, including the turbulent political, social and economic environment during the “Arab Spring”. My articles sought to present up-to-date information from various sources, providing a balanced, detailed overview of topics whilst provoking discussion.

I also write features following my personal travel experiences, which I’ve had published in Wanderlust Travel Magazine, TNT Magazine, ihoppers travel guides and Summit magazine, among others.

When travelling, I’m always keen to immerse myself into the culture as well as experience my new natural surroundings via some outdoor sports. In particular, I’m an avid climber, open water swimmer, runner and hiker. I’ve been active in the development of the climbing scene in Cyprus, which has involved recently writing the first climbing brochure for the Cyprus Tourism Organisation (CTO). I’ve written a selection of articles about climbing for Climber magazine and Summit magazine (the British Mountaineering Council magazine).

With an interest in video documentaries, I recently embarked on a project to make my own documentary about a unique journey I took across Cyprus. I walked across the country along the 255km-long Kyrenia Mountain Range, and challenged myself to do this whilst living solely off the wild land (no cultivated crops). I conducted a great deal of research on foraging as well as documentary-making prior to this 13-day epic, and am now at the editing stage. I kept a blog commentary of my journey at theintrepidgoat.com.

I’ve also applied my editorial and interviewing skills to the healthcare field via the platforms of healthmanagement.org and various healthcare journals published by MindBYTE Communications. I was managing editor of ICU Management journal and regularly attended international medical congresses where I met with influential physicians who contributed knowledge and insight to these prominent media platforms. I continue to work with this media team in communicating opinions, new management practices, raising awareness and understanding of challenges, and offering solutions to common problems.

I’m an SEO advisor and have consulted for a number of websites on this, in addition to working as a regular blogger and article writer for a number of sites including Spiel Animations (formerly Qudos Animations), SHESAID, and healthmanagement.org.

Other topics I’ve enjoyed writing about include education, politics, feminism as well as values and ideas communicated through films, animations and marketing. I also write poetry when the mood takes me :)
