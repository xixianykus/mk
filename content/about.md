summary: "About this site and what it's for."

This site is for trying out various technologies that can be used by Hugo static sites. Things that I might try include:

- Decap and other CMS technologies
- npm based scripts and possibly some others like pnpm and Yarn for example
- Setting up and using Hugo modules
- Recent and not so recent CSS technologies inc. animation etc.

For more see the [code section](/code/).

It's built on Github and hosted by Netlify and is currently using Decap CMS.
