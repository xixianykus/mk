## Ideas to try out on this site

- [Giscus](https://giscus.app/) is a comments system that requires no backend server and instead uses Github comments. Bryceway also has [a post on Giscus](https://www.brycewray.com/posts/2023/08/making-giscus-less-gabby/).
- Trying out Sveltia CMS. First try got the problem that the `git-gateway` backend was unsupported.
- Bunch of npm stuff
- Hugo modules
